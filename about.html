          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="about-text">
          I’m a B.Com graduate with a strong passion for software development and IT education. Currently working as a Programming and IT Faculty, I specialize in teaching core programming, web design, and application development using industry-relevant tools and technologies.
            <br><br>
          Over the past few years, I have gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, WordPress, and Python, along with backend frameworks like Django and .NET. I also have working knowledge of SQL at the application level, allowing me to build functional and data-driven applications.
            <br><br>
            While I come from a commerce background, my career focus has shifted toward full-stack web development. I’m currently enhancing my skills through self-study and project-based learning in modern stacks such as Python-Django and .NET, aiming to transition into a full-time Full-Stack Developer role.
          <br><br>
          My experience as a faculty member has helped me develop strong communication, mentoring, and problem-solving skills — all of which complement my technical growth as a developer.
